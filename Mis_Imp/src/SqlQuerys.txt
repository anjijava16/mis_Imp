Query:HOW CAN I CHECK HOW MANY TIMES A CHARACTER EXISTS IN A STRING ? 
EX: 123,123,123,123,123 
I WANT TO CHECK HOW MANY TIMES "," EXISTS ON THAT STRING

Ans:select regexp_count('123,123,123,123,123',',') from dual;

Select length('123,123,123,123')-length(replace('123,123,123,123',',','')) from dual
